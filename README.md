My first repository

File .gitignore terraform according the tutorial. Ignores Local .terraform directories. .tfstate files. Crash log files.
Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as password, private keys, and other secrets.
Ignore CLI configuration files and Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so.
